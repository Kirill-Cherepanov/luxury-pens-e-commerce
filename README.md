# Luxury Pens E-Commerce Website

*Admittedly I was too lazy to finish the project, since I came to dislike it halfway through. That's why home and about pages are still in development. Please navigate to /store after visiting the site. It along with /basket work as intended*

An E-Commerce website created to showcase and sell luxury pens, serving as a meaningful project to practice using Typescript and explore Tailwind for simplified styles.

This project allowed me to dive back into Typescript after a while, and the experience was fantastic, especially when combined with Tailwind, which significantly streamlined the styling process. It also provided a valuable opportunity to explore UI design, an area I'm still learning and improving.

Throughout this journey, I realized how Typescript comes to the rescue, even during late-night coding sessions when my concentration is waning.

While this website focuses on luxury pens, please note that I don't plan to develop Home and About pages as crafting content and designs for them would require considerable effort.

In conclusion, this project represents a simple yet meaningful endeavor to test and enhance my skills, incorporating the power of Typescript and the convenience of Tailwind CSS.
