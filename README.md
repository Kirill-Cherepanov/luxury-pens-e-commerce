# An E-Commerce website for selling pens

Deploy: https://kirill-cherepanov.github.io/luxury-pens-e-commerce/

It was quite a while ago, the last time I used typescript. So I decided to do something simple but meaningful at the same time (too small projects are meaningless to do with ts imo). I also only recently started stydying UI design (I'm so bad at it) and at the same time wanted to try out tailwind. So something like an E-Commerce website was perfect for the task.

It was a good experience. I found that I very much like using both tailwind, it makes writing styles so much easier. Also typescript saves your a\*\* when you are half-asleep late at night writing code.

I don't plan to write Home and About pages. It would require some heavy lifting to write texts and make designs for them. So I'll pass.

So, yeah, there is nothing much to tell about. A pretty simple project to test my skills, that's it.
